Based on the provided 3D array of captured radio data from your car key and the goal of identifying any patterns, here is a detailed report on the potential structure and patterns within the data:

### Overview
- **Data Source**: The data is captured from an RTL-SDR, representing radio signals from a car key in a 3D array format.
- **Dataset Composition**: Each top-level array item represents a complete radio signal pulse from the car key.
- **Data Depth**: The hierarchical structure is three levels deep:
    - **Top Level**: Array of radio signal pulses.
    - **Second Level**: Each pulse is divided into groups of bytes.
    - **Third Level**: Individual bytes that make up each group.

### Observations
1. **Padding and Empty Data**:
    - Many sections of the dataset, especially in the third level, contain an abundance of zeroes, which could represent padding or unused parts of the radio signal.
    - Some radio signal pulses contain very minimal data, indicating possible noise or non-relevant sections of the capture.

2. **Consistent Patterns**:
    - Certain patterns repeat across various signal pulses, including sequences like `[0,0],[0,0]`, which could be delimiters or markers.
    - Consistent byte patterns are seen in multiple groups, especially in specific positions within the second-level arrays.

3. **Possible Bit Shifts or Byte Alignments**:
    - The presence of single or double-byte patterns such as `128,0` might indicate bit shifts or alignments that indicate start/stop delimiters or specific important bits within the signal.

4. **End Marker**:
    - Some arrays end with `[255]`. The value `255` could be a special marker denoting the end of a message or segment.

### Potential Formatting or Encoding
- **NRZ Encoding**: This format is commonly used in radio communication, where a `0` or `1` is distinguished by a differential change rather than an absolute value. Look for repeating sequences that might break this pattern.
- **Manchester Encoding**: Another common encoding method where each bit of data is represented by a transition in state. If the data consistently switches in patterns, this might be a clue.
- **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)**: Each bit of data could be represented by the duration of the high or low state. Analyze the timing between byte sequences.

### Recommendations for Further Analysis
1. **Identify Header and Footer**:
    - Look for consistent patterns at the beginning and end of each signal pulse. Headers could help in segmenting each message properly.

2. **Checksum Identification**:
    - Some signals might be carrying checksums for validation. Single bytes or groups of bytes might repeat in a way indicating checksum bytes. Try CRC-8, CRC-16 checksums with the dataset.

3. **Frequency Analysis**:
    - Perform spectral analysis to decode frequency-based encodings or detect modulations.

4. **Statistical Analysis**:
    - Compute the frequency of each byte in different positions to identify non-random sequences. Bytes appearing at consistent intervals might be part of the protocol.

### Example Analysis:
- **Signal 0**:
    ```python
    [
      [9,0],[0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,64],[2,0,0,40],
      [64,0],[0,10,145,0],[168],[147,96],[208],[208,2,0,0],[0,0],[0,16,0,0,0,0],[0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0],[0,0,0,8,64],[16,0], ...
    ]
    ```
    - This signal exhibits quite a bit of padding (`[0,0]`), potential header info (`[9,0]`), and end marker (`[255]`). Specific bytes such as `147, 96`, `208, 2, 0, 0` are likely part of the core signal.

### Tools for Analysis
- **Libraries**: Use tools like `numpy` and `pandas` in Python for array manipulation and pattern recognition.
- **Visualization**: Visualize data density and transitions using plotting libraries like `matplotlib`.
- **Bitwise Operations**: To check bit-level patterns, apply bitwise operations to the array and correlate results.

Given the above insights, a deeper understanding of the specific encoding and signal pattern recognition techniques can help fully decode the raw data of your car key.
