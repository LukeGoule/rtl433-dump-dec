### Report on Patterns in the Data

1. **Overall Structure**:
   - The dataset is a 3D array where each top-level array item represents a radio signal pulse generated by the car key.
   - Each second-level array is a collection of bytes grouped together.
   - Individual bytes received by the SDR are found in the innermost arrays.

2. **Common Patterns**:
   - **Zeros**:
     - There are frequent sequences of zeros, particularly in the innermost arrays. 
     - This could indicate periods of no transmission, padding, or delimiters between meaningful data segments.
   - **Consistent Byte Lengths**:
     - Many second-level arrays seem to have a consistent number of bytes, which might imply a structured packet format.
   - **Specific Byte Values at Certain Positions**:
     - Some byte positions within packets seem to have repeating or common values across different pulses. For instance, many packets start with `[9, 0]`.
   - **Presence of Non-Zero Data**:
     - Specific segments within some pulses demonstrate structured non-zero data, which likely contains the critical information.

3. **Repetitive Patterns**:
   - **Reoccurring Arrays**:
     - Certain arrays, such as `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, `[0, 0]`, and `[255]`, are repeated frequently.
   - **Fixed Array Sizes**:
     - Many pulses showcase a predictable pattern in size and structure, suggesting a fixed data transmission format.

### Insights on Next Steps

1. **Identify Headers/Footers**:
   - Look for initial common bytes (like `[9, 0]`) and trailing bytes that might serve as headers or footers for each signal pulse.

2. **Checksum Identification**:
   - If checksums are present, they will usually have specific predictable changes in relation to the rest of the data. Focus on bytes that vary consistently when the rest of the message changes.

3. **Zero Padding Analysis**:
   - Investigate the zero-padded segments to understand if they delineate different fields or are just placeholders.
   
4. **Pattern Isolation**:
   - Isolate the non-zero data-heavy regions within each pulse for more focused analysis. These regions likely contain the essential bits of information.

### Methods for Deeper Understanding

1. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - **Frequency Analysis**:
     - Calculate the frequency of occurrence of each byte value at each position within the signal pulses to identify significant bytes.
   - **Variation Analysis**:
     - Analyze how bytes vary across different pulses, considering some may represent dynamic data (like changing state) and others static (like device identifiers).

2. **Differential Analysis**:
   - Compare differences between successive pulses to identify invariant regions that could represent static information (like device IDs or fixed protocol markers) versus dynamic fields (commands/signals).

3. **Bit-level Inspection**:
   - Convert the bytes to binary and inspect the bit-level changes to determine if the protocol uses sub-byte level encoding (common in many radio protocols).

4. **Cross-correlation with Known Data**:
   - If any part of the raw data can be tied to specific known states or actions (like lock, unlock, etc.), use this to correlate observed patterns with specific actions.

5. **Use SDR Tools**:
   - Use software-defined radio tools to replay the data and see if the signals can be recognized or interpreted by other equipment or software.

6. **Protocol Analysis Tools**:
   - Utilize tools designed for protocol analysis to approximate or reverse-engineer the data format.

7. **Expert Consultation**:
   - If accessible, consulting documentation or experts familiar with car key protocols and the specific device in use may provide direct insights into the data format.

By combining these methods and insights, you can gradually uncover the structure and meaning behind your dataset's radio signals.
