### RTL433DumpDec
This is a simple test application to:
- Experiment with CLI with Symfony.
- See if I can decode the raw output of RTL433 by copying from terminal and pasting into a text file. This tool should be able to, at the very least, produce a report on the data to point out patterns. Don't expect great results.
