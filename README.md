### RTL433DumpDec

# What?
This is a debug application to:
- Experiment with CLI applications with Symfony.
- See if I can decode the raw output of RTL433 by copying from terminal and pasting into a text file. 
- This tool should be able to, at the very least; 
  - [✅] Produce a report on the data to point out patterns.
  - [✅] Give suggestions on next steps for better analysis of the data.
- This software however should not be able to;
  - Provide any form of unethical "hacking" tool.
  - Have any real world applications outside of curiosity.

# How to use?
1. Using RTL433 and its associated hardware, scan a signal (in my case, my car key) and make sure the `-vvv` option is used on rtl_433.
2. Copy the data from terminal into `data/data.txt`.
3. Enter your OpenAI (ChatGPT) API key into the entry in `.env`, which if not already existing should be generated by copying .env.example or renaming it.
4. Run `composer install` and make sure all packages install cleanly.
5. Run `php app decode` to format the data and throw it through ChatGPT.

# But, why?
1. Honestly, I am not sure - if someone has the technical capabilities to capture the signal for a car key: they can replay it without going through a process to extract the raw data.
2. It's fun to play with ChatGPT's API and push its limits. So far I have had success with up to 3000 lines of data parsed and "analysed".
